# my sublime setting 

Today i have seen a south Indian movie. After wasting 2 hours I feel like an idiot. Story was so cheap romeo style, shitty... very childish. My 2 hours lost. shit shit shit. I will know the writer name before watching any movie. If its PURI Jogannath, then it could be worth watching...       

-------------------
Its my sublime setting file and folder     

-------------------
I can't install php linter in my pc due to package missing in package control. then I just download linter.py file from sublime-linter-php github repo. Its work like charm.       

-------------------

sublime linter php didn't work in mac. This is because it require install sublime linter using homebrew with package control
