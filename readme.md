# my sublime setting 

-------------------
Its my sublime setting file and folder     

-------------------
I can't install php linter in my pc due to package missing in package control. then I just download linter.py file from sublime-linter-php github repo. Its work like charm.       

-------------------

sublime linter php didn't work in mac. This is because it require install sublime linter using homebrew with package control
